# Ball Tracking Robot
<!-- Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails! 
-->

The ball tracking robot uses object tracking to follow the ball. With the use of the python library, opencv, the camera can recognize faces, detect objects, and much more. This project uses a raspberry pi, pi camera, motor driver to control the motors, dc motors to control the wheels, and a ultrasonic sensor to avoid object collision.

# Starter Project
For my starter project, I created the game console. I chose this project because it seemed coolest out of all the starter projects. This game console includes Tetris, Snake, Racing, Space Invaders, and Slots. How this game console works is whenever a button is pressed, it sends a signal to the chip, which is then displayed on the LED dot matrix. The red switch is used to turn on the console, the yellow button is used pause the game, the green button starts the game, and the blue buttons controls the LEDs. A challenge when creating this starter project is soldering. I accidentally burnt some parts with the soldering iron, but my game console still works. To avoid this, pay attention to what your soldering iron is touching.

<!-- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
